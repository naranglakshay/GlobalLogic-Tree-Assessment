4) On click of state element - display state details, name, and population
5) Display population as "crores", "lakhs" etc.
6) Implement expand all and collapse all functionality. 
7) Write unit tests to verify
              a) click of parent node, should display child nodes
              b) default state is all are collapsed
              c) unit tests for expand and collapse functionality
